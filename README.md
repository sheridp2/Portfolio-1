# Portfolio
Preliminary Portfolio

## User Stories
* As a User, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
* As a User, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
* As a User, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.


## Developer Stories
* As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup.
* As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me.
* As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.
* As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.
